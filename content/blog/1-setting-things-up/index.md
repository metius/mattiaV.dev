description: "How I configured my dev workstation"
---

This is my first post on my brand new blog! How exciting!

In this post I will describe how I've set up my laptop for work as web developer. It is moslty a way for save the things for myself, but also to share with others about how to configure a Linux workstation to work in a more productive way ( in my opinion, of course). Also, I will update it from time to time as I will eventually change or modify the setup I will describe here.

## Operating System

I'm currently using [KDE Neon](https://neon.kde.org/) as OS, an Ubuntu-based OS developed by the KDE team. I've choosed this version mostly because I'm looking to have always the most updated version of KDE and [Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop). 
KDE is a very configurable Desktop Environment that allows the user to take control of every single expect of the configuration. It is also very extendable using other widget and plugins.

## Desktop configuration

Plasma is great out of the box, but I'd prefered to change the default configuration to a Mac OS-like user interface, since I consider it more efficient and productive.

**Dock:** For the dock I've installed [Latte Dock](https://store.kde.org/p/1169519/), a dock based on Plasma frameworks that provides an intuitive and elegant experience. It is really easy to configure and to adapt on every user taste.

With Latte dock, I've also installed two Plasma widget to replicate the OSX-like top panel:

[Application Title](https://store.kde.org/p/1199712/){:target="_blank"}



On the System Settings, I've changed the following settings:

**Global Theme:** Arc Dark

**Plasma Style:** Arc Dark

**Application Style -> Window Decoration:** Breezemite dark (installed separately)

**Icons:** La Capitaine (installed separately)

## Editor configuration

The editor I use is [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/), a fork of very popular Microsoft's Visual Studio Code editor. It’s identical to VS Code with the single biggest difference that unlike VS Code, VSCodium doesn’t track your usage data.

I've configuered the editor with:

**Color Theme:** [Snazzy Operator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaronthomas.vscode-snazzy-operator)

**Font:** [Operator mono Lig](https://github.com/kiliman/operator-mono-lig)

**Extensions:** 
  
  [Rainbow Brackets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=2gua.rainbow-brackets)
  
  [Snazzy Operator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaronthomas.vscode-snazzy-operator)
  
  [Reactjs code snippet](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xabikos.ReactSnippets)
  
  [vscode-icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscode-icons-team.vscode-icons)

I also personally like to leave the navigation bar on the right, I feel like it leaves much more space :)

## Conclusion

This is a simple post to save and share my current set up. This will be a *dynamic* post since I plan to update it based on new features, extension or even new Linux Distro I will try along the way.

It is definetely not perfect but it makes me work in a more productive way.

Something else I will aslo test in the near future are the KDE Activities, even if I'm not sure they will fit my needs.

Hope you liked my first post! :)
